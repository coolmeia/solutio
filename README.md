**Solutio | Cloud of Solutions** is a database, social network and open inovation platform dedicated to show, share, improve and make possible the replication of social and aproprietade techniques, methods, tools and good practices built for the Common Good.
Since there's no actual tool or platform that mix all the qualities above, Solutio is dedicated to find and share solutions to improve the wellbeing and the quality of life of citizens all over the world. We can achieve this by making knowledge about practical issues of day by day life available to all, freely and in an open source environment, where solutions of all kind became forever open.


 

## What's the promise?

To be the best database, social network and open innovation platform to show, improve and permit the replication os social, learning and cooperation technologies, as well as initiatives, models, tools, techniques, good practices and solutions dedicated to social, environmental, economic, educational, cultural and political change. In general, simple solutions, that can be implemented by individuals, small groups of persons or organized collectives (or even hole communities). Solutions will at first be presented in portuguese and in english; but ot would be wonderful if anyone could translate them to they're own language ;)

 

## Under the Hood

Solutio can be used as three different things:

- a place to find interest and useful solutions to improve personal and collective problems, proned to a more humane, convivial, equanimous and sustainable world

- a place to share, develop and improve collectively this solutions, sharing new adaptations made by the community over previous solutions

- a social network where people that want to build a better world for everyone and not only from themselves can join and share their solutions to build this "other possible world"
